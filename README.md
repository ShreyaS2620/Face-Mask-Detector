# Face-Mask-Detector
Mask-detection-using-openCV
Detects in real-time if the person is wearing a mask or not.

STEPS
1. I seperated the dataset into test and train.

2. I defined the no. of epoches[10] and the batch size[32].

3. I used MobileNetV2 to classify the images either wearing mask or not wearing mask.

4. I trained the model on the dataset.

5. I then tested the model on the test dataset.

6. I then used opencv to analyse real-time video and to make real-timeprediction if the person is wearing mask or not.
